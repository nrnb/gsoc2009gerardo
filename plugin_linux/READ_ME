Instructions for building the plugin:

1- Modify line 27 of build.xml, so that it points to your cytoscape installation folder.

2- Modify lines 14 and 16 of src/gpuGraphDrawing/Makefile, so that both CUDPP and CUDA variables point to the installation folders of CUDPP and CUDA.

3- Run "ant copy_jar" command on the plugin folder. This will automatically put the plugin in the cytoscape plugin folder.
